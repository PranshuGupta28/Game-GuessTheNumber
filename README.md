# 🎯 Guess The Number Game

A simple and interactive "Guess the Number" game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts. It's fun, responsive, and beginner-friendly!

## 🕹️ How to Play

- The game will generate a secret number between a defined range (e.g., 1 to 100).
- You try to guess the number in as few attempts as possible.
- After each guess, you’ll get a hint:
  - "Too high"
  - "Too low"
  - Or "Correct!" when you guess it right.
- The game ends once you guess correctly or run out of attempts.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML** – for the game structure
- **CSS** – for styling the layout and visuals
- **JavaScript** – for game logic, input handling, and interactivity
